This workspace contains 'examples' directory. Press '+' sign on the left
to expand it. You'll find few examples, each of them consisting of
two versions - parallel and sequential. So, you'll be able to compare execution
times of each version to see the difference between parallel and sequential
code running in our parallel machine.

If you registered and logged in, you get your own workspace, where you can
alter the examples code and save them. Also, You can create  more experiments,
adding you own new files/examples.

You feedback on your experience with Parallel Machine is strongly appreciated.
Please send feedbacks and/or questions to 'support@prodata.lt'
